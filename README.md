# Hercules Ontology
Here you will find the development of the ontology for the Hercules project.

## Repo structure

 - **ci:** Contains the source code used for the continuos integration of the ontology and the tests.
 - **src:** Contains the OWL files. This folder is being used by the Continuous Integration system to validate the ontology.
 - **alignments:**.
 - **proposals:** Contains thew proposals for additions/deletions/modifications of the ontology.
 - **proposal-template:** Contains the template used to submit proposals via `pull requests`.
 - **releases:** Contains the different releases of the ontology with a relation of the proposals / featuresthat have been added.
 
 After every GitHub release, each OWL file is merged into a final graph and serialized in multiple formats (rdf/xml, ttl, n3...). This merged graph is available under the gh-pages branch, which follows this structure:
 - **current**: Contains the current version of the ontology in multiple formats
 - **YYYY-MM-DD**: Each one of these folders contains a previous version of the ontology created in the given date.
 - **common**: Additional resources used to render the final HTML generated by LODE.
 
The HTML generated by LODE is accessible at https://herculescrue.github.io/ib-hercules-ontology/current/asio.html

## Project information
The University of Murcia signed on November 29, 2017, a Covenant with the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness backing the “HÉRCULES: Semantic University Research Data” Project with a budget of FIVE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY-TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED euros with an 80% of co-financiering from the European Regional Development Fund program (ERDF) within the 2014-2020 period.  

The project arose as a CRUE initiative, to create the basis for a new collaboration model between universities, to develop the information management systems and with the main objective of encouraging this type of collaboration.

Therefore, the purpose of this agreement was to contribute to the improvement of public services and business innovation and research through the improvement of:
 - efficiency in public investment by decreasing the duplication of investment in R&D.
 - efficiency of research in universities.
 - scientific dissemination of research results.
 - detection of synergies in R&D between universities.
 - transfer of R&D results to companies.
 - efficiency in the management of research.

by creating a research management system with semantic capacities based on semantic open data and that will provide a global view of the research data contained in the Spanish University System.
