                      asio:projectObjective """The global demand for dairy products is expected to surge by 36% over the next decade in a manner that is progressively insatiable by existing technologies. The dairy industry relies on bovine reproduction, yet cow fertility is declining and the exact causes are not fully understood. It is clear, however, that the quality of bovine oocytes is decreasing.

In mammals, the ovarian reserve of oocytes stored within quiescent primordial follicles is non-renewable. Oocyte develop and mature within distinctive follicular microenvironments under tightly regulated molecular and physical conditions. Similarly, preimplantation embryo development is supported within a specialized microenvironment that is surrounded by the zona pellucida and insulated from external soluble and mechanical inputs. Characterizing and understanding these environments and how they affect reproductive processes is a key toward improving assisted reproductive technologies in bovine species.

Our premise is that molecular characterization of endocrine and paracrine signalling pathways must be complemented with understanding the mechanical regulation of reproductive biology. This premise is supported by recent finding showing that physical stresses and the mechanical compliance of the extracellular surroundings serve as potent regulators of cell fates in regeneration processes, development, and disease.

I propose to employ a biophysical and computational toolbox to study the mechanobiology of reproduction with application to bovine embryo-based technologies. By mimicking the mechanical properties of the ovarian cortical niche, which I will characterize using freshly derived ovaries, I will design an in vitro system for supporting follicle growth. Mechanical profiling of the entire developmental course from oocyte maturation to preimplantation embryogenesis will generate mechanistic insights into the physical regulation of reproductive processes."""@en ;

However, the high cost of instrumentation and reagents, the multifaceted expertise required for correct use and the legal and ethical issues hamper access to NGS technologies for many researchers. EASI-Genomics addresses those challenges by unifying the major European genome centers that provide external access to their facilities. The mission of EASI-Genomics is to facilitate access to cutting-edge DNA sequencing technologies to researchers from both academia and industry, within a framework that ensures compliance with ethical and legal requirements, as well as FAIR and secure data management. EASI-Genomics will provide fully funded access to more than 150 transnational access projects, selected through public calls and a rigorous, fair and transparent peer-review process.
                      Each funded study will be supported from design, through sequencing, to data analysis. EASI-Genomics will provide more than 100 Tb of sequence and more than 25,000 hours of bioinformatic, analytical and data management support to the user community. As outlined in the call, EASI-Genomics will provide access to advanced methods that go beyond what is commercially available. The focus will be on more complex procedures involving short-reads, long-reads, in situ sequencing and single-cell analysis.
                      Complex integrative projects and projects on non-human samples will also be highlighted. Finally, EASI-Genomics will support the wider NGS community to improve their quality control processes by offering open inter-laboratory comparisons allowing them to obtain ISO certification and accreditation in line with many of the EASI-Genomic partners. The EASI-Genomics project aims to build a community of practice, which leverages advanced sequencing technologies beyond country and sector borders to tackle global challenges in science."""@en ;

The project will also include in smaller fraction support to detector development, facility setups and samples fabrication to prepare important measurements and validations that are not possible in the time framework of the present proposal but that will be required in near future for the safe and efficient use of nuclear technologies.
The selection of topics, isotopes, reactions, measurements, experiments and evaluation has been made taking into account the relevance, expected impact and priorities of the resulting data according to the NEA/OECD and IAEA high priority lists and committees as well as the experience of the participants and of previous EU proposals with large participation of the partners for the present proposal (CHANDA, ANDES,…). The impact has been evaluated from the perspective of a safe, efficient and competitive use of nuclear technologies.
In comparison with previous projects, the present proposal proposes to concentrate more efforts on delivering actual results than in the preparation for the future, by enhancing the support to evaluations, validations and actual measurements. Also special attention has been paid to make sure that the topics included cover the non-energy application requiring nuclear data as well as it will cover the needs of the nuclear energy sector.
Respecting those principles, the proposal has also tried to be as inclusive to the different EU research groups and countries as possible maintaining the manageability of the project, its efficiency and the maximum quality and relevance of the action and involved partners."""@en ;
