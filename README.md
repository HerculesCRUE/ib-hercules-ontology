# ib-hercules-ontology
After every GitHub release, each OWL file is merged into a final graph and serialized in multiple formats (rdf/xml, ttl, n3...). 
This merged graph is available under this branch, which follows this structure:

* current: Contains the current version of the ontology in multiple formats
* YYYY-MM-DD: Each one of these folders contains a previous version of the ontology created in the given date.
* common: Additional resources used to render the final HTML generated by LODE.

The HTML generated by LODE is accessible at https://herculescrue.github.io/ib-hercules-ontology/current/asio.html
