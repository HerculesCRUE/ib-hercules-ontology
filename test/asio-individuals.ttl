The dairy industry relies on bovine reproduction, yet cow fertility is declining and the exact causes are not fully understood. It is clear, however, that the quality of bovine oocytes is decreasing.

In mammals, the ovarian reserve of oocytes stored within quiescent primordial follicles is non-renewable. Oocyte develop and mature within distinctive follicular microenvironments under tightly regulated molecular and physical conditions. Similarly, preimplantation embryo development is supported within a specialized microenvironment that is surrounded by the zona pellucida and insulated from external soluble and mechanical inputs. Characterizing and understanding these environments and how they affect reproductive processes is a key toward improving assisted reproductive technologies in bovine species.

Our premise is that molecular characterization of endocrine and paracrine signalling pathways must be complemented with understanding the mechanical regulation of reproductive biology. This premise is supported by recent finding showing that physical stresses and the mechanical compliance of the extracellular surroundings serve as potent regulators of cell fates in regeneration processes, development, and disease.

I propose to employ a biophysical and computational toolbox to study the mechanobiology of reproduction with application to bovine embryo-based technologies. By mimicking the mechanical properties of the ovarian cortical niche, which I will characterize using freshly derived ovaries, I will design an in vitro system for supporting follicle growth. Mechanical profiling of the entire developmental course from oocyte maturation to preimplantation embryogenesis will generate mechanistic insights into the physical regulation of reproductive processes."""@en ;

The problems are related in that they involve a liquid layer flowing past the moving solid boundary. As well as being mathematically challenging they also all have immediate and important applications. During the project mathematical models will be developed and analysed for each of these problems. The work will begin with simple one-dimensional models. Approximate analytical solutions will be sought and compared, when possible, against existing exact and numerical solutions. The methods will then be extended to deal with the more complex two and three dimensional formulations where exact solutions are not available. This problem is complicated by the fluid flow which must be coupled to the thermal problem."@en ;

However, the high cost of instrumentation and reagents, the multifaceted expertise required for correct use and the legal and ethical issues hamper access to NGS technologies for many researchers. EASI-Genomics addresses those challenges by unifying the major European genome centers that provide external access to their facilities. The mission of EASI-Genomics is to facilitate access to cutting-edge DNA sequencing technologies to researchers from both academia and industry, within a framework that ensures compliance with ethical and legal requirements, as well as FAIR and secure data management. EASI-Genomics will provide fully funded access to more than 150 transnational access projects, selected through public calls and a rigorous, fair and transparent peer-review process.
                      Each funded study will be supported from design, through sequencing, to data analysis. EASI-Genomics will provide more than 100 Tb of sequence and more than 25,000 hours of bioinformatic, analytical and data management support to the user community. As outlined in the call, EASI-Genomics will provide access to advanced methods that go beyond what is commercially available. The focus will be on more complex procedures involving short-reads, long-reads, in situ sequencing and single-cell analysis.
                      Complex integrative projects and projects on non-human samples will also be highlighted. Finally, EASI-Genomics will support the wider NGS community to improve their quality control processes by offering open inter-laboratory comparisons allowing them to obtain ISO certification and accreditation in line with many of the EASI-Genomic partners. The EASI-Genomics project aims to build a community of practice, which leverages advanced sequencing technologies beyond country and sector borders to tackle global challenges in science."""@en ;

We will train 13 Early Stage Researchers (ESR), equipping them with the skills, knowledge, expertise, and enthusiasm necessary to develop successful future careers in the biomedical field (in academia or the private sector). Together with European experts in chromatin biology, 3D genomics, and research design, these ESRs will work towards the goal of identifying novel alterations in chromatin topology responsible for cellular malfunctions to: i) develop new diagnostic tools, ii) effectively communicate research results through specific toolkits; and iii) identify novel therapeutic targets with the potential to be exploited as treatments.
Alteration of gene regulation occurs naturally during aging and underlies several human diseases. Its better characterization requires a deeper understanding of the spatial organization of the genome. We will investigate how the genome organizes in 3D over time, and how the 3D organization is related to gene regulation in health and disease. We will use and develop technologies in imaging, cell biology, genomics, and computational modelling and will focus on translating our results into clinical applications. ESRs will thereby receive training with state-of-the-art technologies in distinct research areas and in modules with theoretical and hands-on sessions on transferable skills: entrepreneurship, management, communication, and outreach.
ChromDesign comprises 6 work packages: WP1–4 address the 4 main areas of chromatin biology and 3D genomics; WP5 applies the knowledge obtained from WPs1–4 into translational research; WP6 develops (with a dedicated ESR) a set of design toolkits for communicating results to scientists, the public, and schools; and WP7 ensures quality training for ESRs."""@en ;

However, this technology has not been yet widely implemented, since it requires the collaboration of experts in multiple fields and costly computational tools.

The EdgeTwins HPC project brings a different approach that will extend digital twins to new market segments and users (i.e. SMEs). It aims to develop an open-source software tool (builder) to produce digital twins that run on the Edge. That is, they are installed on the physical asset they represent, and operate in very constrained compute environments. This approach will enable a new breed of novel real-time applications, from autonomous vehicles to small devices.

The main objective of this FET Innovation Launchpad project is to evaluate the business feasibility of an open-source Digital Twin builder software for Edge applications and develop and test a demonstrator (alpha) for one or more use cases identified in the market analysis.

To do so, the participants will leverage on the high-performance computing software stemming of the ExaQute FET Proactive project. These assets will allow, using Reduced Order Modelling techniques, to model complex 4D simulations to later extract the essential features of the solution so that similar results can be obtained at a vastly reduced computational cost."""@en ;

                        asio:projectObjective """QCD is the only sector of the Standard Model where the exploration of the first levels of complexity, built from fundamental interactions at the quantum level, is experimentally feasible. An outstanding example is the thermalised state of QCD matter formed when heavy atomic nuclei are smashed in particle colliders. Systematic experimental studies, carried out in the last two decades, overwhelmingly support the picture of a deconfined state of matter, which behaves as a nearly perfect fluid, formed in a very short time, less than 5 yoctoseconds.

                        The mechanism that so efficiently brings the initial out-of-equilibrium state into a thermalised system is, however, largely unknown. Most surprisingly, LHC experiments have found that collisions of small systems, i.e. proton-proton or proton-lead, seem to indicate the presence of a tiny drop of this fluid in events with a large number of produced particles. These systems have sizes of 1 fm or less, or time-scales of less than 3 ys. To add to the puzzle, jet quenching, the modifications of jet properties due to interactions with the medium, has not been observed in these small systems, while jet quenching and thermalisation are expected to be controlled by the same dynamics.

                        Present experimental tools have limited sensitivity to the actual process of thermalisation. To solve these long-standing questions we propose, as a completely novel strategy, using jet observables to directly access the first yoctoseconds of the collision. This strategy needs developments well beyond the state-of-the-art in three subjects: i) novel theoretical descriptions of the initial stages of the collision — the first 5 ys; ii) jet quenching theory for yoctosecond precision, with new techniques to couple the jet to the surrounding matter and novel parton shower evolution; and iii) jet quenching tools for the 2020’s, where completely novel jet observables will be devised with a focus on determining the initial stages of the collision."""@en ;

The project will also include in smaller fraction support to detector development, facility setups and samples fabrication to prepare important measurements and validations that are not possible in the time framework of the present proposal but that will be required in near future for the safe and efficient use of nuclear technologies.
The selection of topics, isotopes, reactions, measurements, experiments and evaluation has been made taking into account the relevance, expected impact and priorities of the resulting data according to the NEA/OECD and IAEA high priority lists and committees as well as the experience of the participants and of previous EU proposals with large participation of the partners for the present proposal (CHANDA, ANDES,…). The impact has been evaluated from the perspective of a safe, efficient and competitive use of nuclear technologies.
In comparison with previous projects, the present proposal proposes to concentrate more efforts on delivering actual results than in the preparation for the future, by enhancing the support to evaluations, validations and actual measurements. Also special attention has been paid to make sure that the topics included cover the non-energy application requiring nuclear data as well as it will cover the needs of the nuclear energy sector.
Respecting those principles, the proposal has also tried to be as inclusive to the different EU research groups and countries as possible maintaining the manageability of the project, its efficiency and the maximum quality and relevance of the action and involved partners."""@en ;
